Thanks for checking out my release!

To install:

1. Install Python 3.8.3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the Windows Store
2. Navigate to your install directory and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in Command Prompt
3. Navigate to your install directory and run 'py "detergent tft.py"' in Command Prompt
4. Follow the instructions in your terminal window! Get into a TFT lobby, have the created window visible on your screen, and press 'OK' to start the bot!

Troubleshooting:

If these steps don't work, try running the file with 'python "tft.py"' instead (For Windows Store/MacOS/Linux users especially) Likewise, try pip3 instead of pip for installing requirements.
If pip doesn't seem to exist, try installing it here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. Essentially 'save as' from here: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py then run 'py get-pip.py' and try to use pip again
The bot is configured to work with monitor resolution 1920x1080, and League Client resolution 1280x720. You can switch this up though, just re-capture the images in the captures folder!
If you're having issues with Python not working properly, please make sure you have the correct version (3.8.3) installed, and all of the correct module versions installed, as listed in requirements.txt
Make sure to run League and the bot on your main monitor, as it doesn't support additional monitors!
If you need additional help, feel free to reach out to me via an issue. (https://github.com/Detergent13/tft-bot/issues)

Hope you enjoy!
