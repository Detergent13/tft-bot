Thanks for checking out my release!

# Installation:

* Install Python 3.8.3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the Windows Store
* Navigate to your install directory and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in Command Prompt
* Navigate to your install directory and run 'py "tft.py"' in Command Prompt
* Follow the instructions in your terminal window! Get into a TFT lobby, have the created window visible on your screen, and press 'OK' to start the bot!

# Troubleshooting:

* If these steps don't work, try running the file with 'python "tft.py"' instead (For Windows Store/MacOS/Linux users especially) Likewise, try pip3 instead of pip for installing requirements.
* If pip doesn't seem to exist, try installing it here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. Essentially 'save as' from here: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py then run 'py get-pip.py' and try to use pip again
* The bot is configured to work with in-game resolution 1920x1080, and League client resolution 1280x720. You can switch this up though, just re-capture the images in the captures folder!
* If you're having issues with Python not working properly, please make sure you have the correct version (3.8.3) installed, and all of the correct module versions installed, as listed in requirements.txt
* Make sure to run League and the bot on your main monitor, as it doesn't support additional monitors!

Hope you enjoy!
